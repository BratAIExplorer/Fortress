# Fortress Intelligence: The "Super Learning" Roadmap

## The Core Problem
**"I have money, but no time to research, and I don't trust tipsters."**
Most platforms offer *data* (Screeners) or *orders* (Tips). None offer *wisdom* efficiently.

## Gap Analysis: The "Time-Poor" Investor

| The Gap | Current Market Solution | The Fortress Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Context** | 50-page Annual Reports | **"The 1-Minute Thesis"** (Audio/Text) |
| **Skill** | Expensive, long cohorts | **"Mental Model" Cards** (Contextual learning) |
| **Trust** | "Trust me bro" screenshots | **"The Anti-Portfolio"** (Showing our mistakes) |
| **Discipline** | None (Buy/Sell buttons) | **"Decision Journal"** (Forcing a 'Why') |

## Proposed "Super Learning" Features

### 1. Fortress University (Micro-Learning)
*Concept:* Instead of a 10-hour course, embed learning *into* the stock analysis.
*   **"Hover-to-Learn":** When a user hovers over "ROCE", don't just show the number. Show a 30-second video explaining *why* it matters for *this specific sector*.
*   **"The Mental Model Library":** A wiki of concepts (e.g., "Operating Leverage", "Moat", "Cyclicality") linked directly to stocks that exemplify them.
    *   *Example:* "TATASTEEL is a classic lesson in **Operating Leverage**." -> Click to learn.
*   **"The Wisdom Widget":** A daily rotating "Timeless Truth" on the dashboard (e.g., Compounding, Psychology of Panic Selling) to reinforce basics.

### 2. The "Audio Brief" (Passive Consumption)
*Concept:* A Spotify-like playlist of the Fortress 30 theses.
*   **Feature:** "Listen to the Portfolio." A daily 5-minute audio summary of news impacting the Fortress 30, generated by AI but curated by humans.
*   **Affiliate Opportunity:** Audible / Books / Podcasts.

### 3. The Decision Journal (Behavioral Edge)
*Concept:* A private diary for the user.
*   **Feature:** Before they can "mark as owned", they must answer:
    1.  *Why am I buying this?*
    2.  *What would make me sell?*
    3.  *What is my time horizon?*
*   **Value:** Six months later, when the stock drops, they read their own logic. This is the ultimate educational tool.

### 4. "Red Flag" Checklists
*Concept:* Gamified risk assessment.
*   **Feature:** An interactive checklist for every stock.
    *   [ ] Does it have high debt?
    *   [ ] Is the promoter pledging shares?
    *   [ ] Is the CFO resigning often?
*   **Value:** Teaches users *how* to fish, rather than just giving the fish.

## Revenue & Ecosystem Expansion

### 1. Affiliate & Partnerships
*   **Books:** Curated "Must Read" list for each stock (e.g., "Read *The Outsiders* to understand Capital Allocation").
*   **Tools:** "Chart viewed on *TradingView* (Get 10% off)".
*   **Brokerage:** "Execute this trade on *Zerodha*."

### 2. Premium "Deep Dive"
*   **Masterclasses:** "How to Analyze a Bank" (2-hour video).
*   **Community:** "Fortress Fellows" – A private Discord for serious learners.

## Recommendation for Next Steps (Sprint 5)

I recommend we build the **"Mental Model" Engine**.
1.  **Content Source:** We will seed the DB with a "Starter Pack" of 20 classic models (Buffett/Munger/Lynch) so it's not empty. Admin will cultivate this list.
2.  **Wisdom Widget:** Implement the daily tip feature for psychology basics.
3.  **Concept Tooltips:** Build the interactive text system.
